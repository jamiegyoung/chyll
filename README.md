## Setup

Before starting the build, make sure you have populated the `.env` file with the required environment variables localted at server/.env.

***NOTE:*** If you wish to connect to a local MYSQL database, your `DB_HOST` should be set to `host.docker.internal`

If you wish to build and run it manually, follow the steps below:

Once docker is installed, you can build the container by running:
`docker build -t chyll .`

Then to run the container, if you are on Docker-for-mac or Docker-for-Windows 18.03+ run:
`docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env chyll`

Else, if you are on linux, run:
`docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway chyll`
